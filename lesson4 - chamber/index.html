            <p class="jet-black-text light-background">If I go with a light scheme: #333333 - Jet Black. It's slightly lighter than other blacks, so it should be a little nicer on the eyes.</p>
            <p class="sunglow-text dark-background">If I go with a darker scheme: #FFCC00 - Sunglow. It's a bright, happy yellow that I think would represent our sweet little town well. Plus, it's on the town's web site.</p>

            <p class="orange-background">I would go with Spanish orange because it's a common color for our town, it being our high school's main color.</p>
            <p class="blue-background">Alternatively, I'd choose Spanish Blue because blue is associated with trustworthiness, and a nearby town has a slightly darker shade of blue. </p>

► Start developing the page structure and base style. You will be using placeholders for the content in the main section this week. This assignment only requires that you build the header, navigation, and footer information and layout. Your home page must have the same basic structure and content as shown here.  Use your own site plan for references to colors, typography, and other details that you want to customize. You will build upon this same project over many weeks.

► The page must use three viewport general widths of small ("base.css"), medium, and large (phone, tablet, and wide desktop). This means you are required to have three separate CSS files with media queries in the "medium.css" and "large.css" files

► The header must contain a logo, site name, and navigation (nav), spanning the entire screen. You may elect to limit the content width within the header. 

► The header also displays the current date using JavaScript in this format: Wednesday, 24 July 2020.

► The navigation contains four page links and two social media external links. The navigation menu starts with a 'hamburger' button in the small and medium views and is visible in the larger view. The menu must be responsive and use JavaScript to respond to user behavior and toggle between not showing any menu items and showing all the menu items.

► The main section will not be built at this stage of the project but placeholder blocks and general layout should be started. The illustrations provide the sections that are required and where they are to be placed in the respective view sizes. The sections include hero image and call to action, news, event(s), weather, join, and two to three company spotlights.

► The footer contains the logo (a placeholder icon/image is fine for now), contact information, a link to a map, and a base footer with a dynamic copyright year (driven by JavaScript), site name, your name, "WDD 230 Project", and the last modification date driven by JavaScript.
