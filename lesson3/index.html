            <h2>Site purpose:</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of honeygrovetxchamber.com is to educate people interested in Honey Grove on local businesses, events and tourist attractions. This will be done by showing this things off on the home page, as well as providing links to exciting information on each of these topics. 
            <br>The secondary purpose is to bring more people in to the chamber of commerce through memberships, as well as inspire and help bring about more businesses in our community. This will be done in the same manner as the first, by providing easily accessible links, as well as by showing off our existing members and their memberships.</p>
