            <h2>Text:</h2>
            <p class="jet-black-text light-background">If I go with a light scheme: #333333 - Jet Black. It's slightly lighter than other blacks, so it should be a little nicer on the eyes.</p>
            <p class="sunglow-text dark-background">If I go with a darker scheme: #FFCC00 - Sunglow. It's a bright, happy yellow that I think would represent our sweet little town well. Plus, it's on the town's web site.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Header Background:</h2>
            <p>I'm unsure. #EA6803 - Spanish Orange, or #2471A8 - Spanish Blue. </p>
            <p class="orange-background">I would go with Spanish orange because it's a common color for our town, it being our high school's main color.</p>
            <p class="blue-background">Alternatively, I'd choose Spanish Blue because blue is associated with trustworthiness, and a nearby town has a slightly darker shade of blue. </p>
