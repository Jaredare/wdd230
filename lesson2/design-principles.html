                    <p>On Apple's homepage we have a couple pictures of the new Iphone, and that's all that's really shown. There's a lot of white space around the first one which drives the eye to the center of the picture, which is the iPhone. Right underneath is another picture of an iphone with a purple background, and although it isn't technically white I think that it still counts as white because they chose a purple that wouldn't attract attention, and instead sends your attention to the phone in the center. I think the way that they spaced out their text on the page was a good use of white space. It used close to the maximum they could without making it uncomfortable.</p>
